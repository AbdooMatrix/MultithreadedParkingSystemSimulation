# Multithreaded Parking System Simulation

This project simulates a parking system using multithreading techniques to manage parking slots, vehicle entry, and exit. It demonstrates concurrent programming concepts in Java by simulating a system where multiple vehicles can park and exit concurrently, handling resource contention and synchronization.

### Features:
- Multithreaded simulation of parking system
- Vehicle entry and exit management
- Synchronization of parking slot usage

### Technologies:
- Java

### Setup:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Build the project: `mvn clean install`
3. Run the simulation: `java -jar ParkingSystemSimulation.jar`
